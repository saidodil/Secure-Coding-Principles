Issues/struggles encountered:
- Figuring out a proper way to write JUnit tests for methods
   with user input taken from Scanner.
- Finding a proper way to hash passwords and store them in a text file.
- We weren't able to figure out a sufficient way to test our Python version of
   the program, so we didn't perform any tests or captures on it.
